# React-Native-Dev-Environment
All the necessary files to configure your development environment for a brand new React Native project.

## Instructions for Setup
Because a React Native project has alot of configuration files (for both iOS/Android), it is difficult to rename the project, its dependencies, and it's package names. For that reason, it is best to start a new project from scratch, and then copy over files needed to configure the rest of the environment.
